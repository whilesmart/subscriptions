# Subscriptions

Manage user and team subscriptions across multiple applications.

## Overview

This repository contains a service built with NestJS that provides a unified API for validating user and team subscriptions across multiple applications. It streamlines subscription management, saving developers the hassle of implementing redundant subscription checks in each application. Additionally, the service offers added benefits such as federated access, single sign-on (SSO), LDAP integration, and internal user management.

## Features

- **Subscription Validation**: Verify user and team subscriptions across various applications through a single API.
- **Efficient Management**: Eliminate the need for redundant subscription checks in individual applications.
- **Federated Access**: Enable seamless integration of federated access for users across platforms.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Simplify user authentication with single sign-on capabilities.
- **LDAP Integration**: Integrate seamlessly with LDAP for centralized user authentication and authorization.
- **Internal User Management**: Manage users internally within the application, providing flexibility in user management strategies.
